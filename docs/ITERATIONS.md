## Iteration 1

### what went well
- the breathing circle is a good idea
- the breathing instructions are helpful
- 

### where to improve
- there is no way to start or stop the breathing circle
- the breathign circle doesn't grow in and own over time. it just snaps to big or small
- the copy is very basic and needs to be improved and more kind and reassuring to the user
- breathing pattern selector is very basic and there is not visual indication that the user has selected a pattern
- i don't hear any audio cues
- the fonts used are very basic and shoudl be more calming and soothing

### wishlist

- less visual noise on the front page so I can focus on teh breathing circle and am not overwhelemd
- scroll down to get more information about the breathing patterns, techniques that work, success stories from others, etc.
- a way to track if the user is still on the page or has left the page and come back. if they've left an audio cue to bring them back plays
